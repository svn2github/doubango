/* Outline:
*
* we select a y-stretching function depending on the ratio (eg 1:N or N:1).
* it copies scanlines from source to destination, duplicating or omitting
* scanlines as necessary to fit the destination. It copies each scanline
* via the X_FUNC function we passed as an argument: this copies one scanline
* duplicating or omitting pixels to fit the destination: we select an X_FUNC
* depending on the bit-depth as well as the x-stretching ratio.
*
* both x and y stretching functions use the following basic model for deciding
* when to insert/omit elements:
*
* 	delta = <larger extent> -1;
*
*      for (number of destination elements) {
*
*		copy one element
*		advance pointer to larger region
*		delta -= <smaller extent>
*		if (delta < 0) {
*			delta += <larger extent>;
*			advance pointer to smaller region
*		}
*	}
